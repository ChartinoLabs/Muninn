# Testing Parsers

!!! warning "Test fixtures must use real device output"
    Raw CLI output in `input.txt` files **must** come from a live network device, ideally untampered. This ensures that parsers are validated against real-world output, including quirks in formatting, whitespace, and edge cases that only appear on actual hardware.

    **AI-generated CLI output is not acceptable.** Language models frequently produce output that looks plausible but differs from real device output in subtle ways. Contributions with signs of AI-generated test fixtures will not be accepted.

Every parser must have test fixtures that prove it works with real device output. Tests are organized by OS and command, with metadata tracking platform and version coverage.

## Test Case Files

Each test case is a directory containing three files.

### `metadata.yaml`

```yaml
description: Basic clock output with UTC timezone
platform: Catalyst 9300
software_version: IOS-XE 17.12.1
```

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `description` | Brief description of the test scenario | "OSPF neighbors across multiple VRFs" |
| `platform` | Hardware model (or "Unknown") | "Nexus 9336C-FX2" |
| `software_version` | OS version string (or "Unknown") | "NX-OS 10.3(2)" |

### `input.txt`

Raw CLI output exactly as captured from the device:

```
R1# show clock
*04:45:00.857 UTC Thu Aug 7 2025
```

### `expected.json`

Expected parsed output as JSON:

```json
{
  "time": "04:45:00.857",
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "day_of_week": "Thu",
  "month": "Aug",
  "day": "7",
  "year": "2025"
}
```

## Optional `command.txt`

By default, the test harness derives the CLI command from the directory name by converting underscores to spaces (`show_clock` -> `show clock`).

When the real command contains characters that don't work in directory names, add a `command.txt` file at the command-directory level:

```
tests/parsers/iosxe/dir_crashinfo/
├── command.txt
└── 001_basic/
    ├── metadata.yaml
    ├── input.txt
    └── expected.json
```

The `command.txt` file contains the exact command string, nothing else:

```
dir crashinfo:
```

## Running Tests

Parser tests are discovered and parametrized automatically. You can run all of them, or filter by OS or command name:

```bash
# All parser tests
uv run pytest tests/parsers/

# Tests for a specific OS
uv run pytest tests/parsers/iosxe/

# Tests for a specific command
uv run pytest tests/parsers/ -k "show_clock"

# Verbose output with test IDs
uv run pytest tests/parsers/ -v
# Output: test_parser[iosxe/show_clock/001_basic] PASSED
```

## Naming Conventions

- Test case directories are numbered: `001_basic`, `002_empty_output`, `003_multiple_vrfs`
- Start with a simple "happy path" test (`001_basic`)
- Add edge cases and error scenarios as additional test cases

## Contributing Test Data

When contributing test data:

1. **Sanitize production data** - Remove hostnames, IP addresses, and other sensitive information
2. **Include metadata** - All required fields must be populated (use "Unknown" when provenance is unavailable)
3. **Verify accuracy** - Ensure `expected.json` matches what the parser should produce
